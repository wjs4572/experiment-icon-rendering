# Web UI Development Guard Rails

## Safety
- Prefer minimal diffs; avoid wide refactors.
- Do not rename or move files unless explicitly requested.

## Architecture
- Follow existing component patterns and folder structure.
- Reuse existing components and utilities before creating new ones.
- Do not introduce new frameworks or state libraries.

## Responsiveness
- UI must function on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Avoid fixed widths that break smaller screens.

## Styling
- Follow existing styling methodology.
- Avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- Prefer responsive units over fixed pixel values.
