# i18n Locale Consistency and Verification

## Locale file format
- All locale files must be flat key/value pairs only.
- Do NOT use nested objects in any locale file.

## Key consistency
- All keys must be consistent across all locale files.
- If a key exists in any locale file, it must exist in every locale file.

## Defaults for missing translations
- If a non-source locale is missing a key, use the source locale text as the default value.
- Do NOT auto-translate unless explicitly asked.
- Newly added or default-filled keys must be marked unverified in locales/verification.json.

## Verification manifest
- locales/verification.json is the source of truth for verification status.
- When keys are added, ensure an entry exists in locales/verification.json for each locale.
- If the source locale text changes, mark all non-source locales as needs-review.

## Output expectations
- When modifying locale keys, report which keys were added and which locales were updated.
- Do not restructure locale files.

## Locale selection and display

- The language selector must display both language and locale when multiple regional variants exist.
- Do not collapse multiple locales into a single language option.

Examples:
  en      → English
  en-US   → English (United States)
  en-GB   → English (United Kingdom)

- Always show the currently selected locale explicitly.
